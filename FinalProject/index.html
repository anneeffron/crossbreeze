					<p> Icelandic sheepdogs are friendly, outgoing, energetic, loving, loyal companions. They want to be a part of the family and they do not do well if left alone for long periods of time. They are natually clean and do not usually have a "doggy" odor.
						They do shed their coats, especially in the spring and fall. If you are considering an Icie, you should know they like to bark! A lot! All of our dogs have had their hips checked to rule out hip dysplasia and their eyes checked to make sure they
						do not have cataracts. All puppies will have a vet check prior to placement in their new homes. Prospective owners are required to fill out a questionaire and we will attempt to match personalities of puppies to new owners with input from the buyer.

					<p> We specialize in raising and selling registered Icelandic Sheep. This ancient breed is known for its high quality wool, meat and milk.Our sheep are registered with the Canadian Livestock Corp. and we participate in the Voluntary Scrapie Prevention
						Program We have found Icelandic sheep to be wonderful animals for a small farm setting. They are excellent mothers, usually producing twins and raising fast growing lambs on hay or pasture without grain supplementation. They are curious, friendly
						and playful. We halter train all of our lambs for ease of handling. Icelandic sheep are wonderful for clearing brush. They will eat just about anything (they love poison ivy!) Some farms milk their sheep and use the milk in cheese or soap production.
						Their fleeces are great for hand spinning and felting art. These sheep are truly versatile! </p>
