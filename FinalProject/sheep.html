          <h3> Icelandic Sheep Care </h3>
          <p> Here are a few tips I have picked up from experience and other shepherds:

Shelter:  Always provide shade.  Sheep are more sensitive to heat than to cold.
Water:  Fresh water must always be available.
Food:  Icelandic sheep thrive on good grass, legumes, and hay.  They will eat almost anything, but introduce new foods gradually.  Avoid too much alfalfa.  If a sheep eats too much rich food, it can “bloat.”  You should keep a bottle of Therabloat on hand just in case.  Otherwise, 1/2 cup veg. oil, 1/2 cup water and 1/4 cup baking soda syringed into the sheep will help bloat.
Minerals:  I use a brand of mineral called Sweetlix.  I have begun to add SelPlex natural selenium (http://www.sel-plex.com/en/about/pages/default.aspx) and vit. E to my minerals. I use a mix suggested by Elaine Clark of Frelsi Farm:                                  Sweetlix Sheep and Goat (25 lb bag) and add 8 lbs of Sweetlix 16:8 Meat Maker (goat  mineral) .  I add 20-30 oz of SelPlex selenium yeast and 5-10oz of Vit E powder (125,000  units per lb). The selenium and vitamin E varies according to time of year and age of animals. I also mix some Vit E and Selenium into the kelp meal and put it in the feeders with the minerals.  The Selplex can be obtained from North Central Feeds, Gonvick, MN 218-487-6040218-487-6040 ask for Zena. She'll box up small amts.  I also offer dried kelp separately as well as a product called Dyna-Min (http://www.agri-dynamics.com/) that contains copper, cobalt, and many other trace minerals.  Recently it has come to my attention that sheep need more cobalt, so try to find a mineral mix which has cobalt in it.  If you have a grain elevator, they may carry these products or be able to get them for you.  If you can’t locate them, I may be able to help you find a source.
Protein block:  If the sheep are stressed by heat, lambing, travel, heavy worm infestations, etc. I give them a Dumor Sheep or Goat Protein block.  The goat block has some copper in it which Icelandic sheep need in their diet.  They love these!
Treats:   sunflower seeds and shredded beat pulp are healthy snacks.
Worming:  There are many chemical wormers.  Some are no longer effective on sheep parasites. I use: Levasole (levamisole), and Cydectin (Moxidectin).  Valbazen (albendazole) is used for liver flukes and tapeworm,  Check with a vet, Pipestone Sheep Supply, or other livestock supply co. for availability.  Worm according to weight and do not underdose!  Wt. Formula: measure around sheep. This is the girth (G).  Measure the length of the sheep from shoulder to hip (L).  G x G x L divided by 300 = weight.  Worm the sheep based on the color of its inner eyelid.  Pull out the lower lid and examine it.  If it is pale pink or white, worm the sheep.  In spring and summer, check eyelids often (every week or two).  Another sign of serious parasites is “bottle jaw.”  This is a swelling under the lower jaw.  If you see this, worm immediately!  Some shepherds use organic methods of worming with or instead of chemical wormers.  See Drench Recipe in packet for one vitamin and mineral drench that I use.  Parasite information:  http://www.sheep101.info/201/parasite.html
Vaccinations:  Sheep should receive a CDT booster every spring.  Lambs need two doses the first year.
Shearing:  Icelandic sheep are generally sheared in spring and fall (March and October.)  The spring clip is shorter and better for felting; the fall clip is longer and is used for spinning.
Hooves:  Most shepherds trim their sheep’s hooves a couple of time per year with trimmers made for that purpose. (Pipestone or Premier)
Supplies:  Syringes and needles, BoSe (selenium and vit. E) PenG and LA 200 (antibiotics)
Ask questions!  Call or e-mail myself (269-792-1437269-792-1437, colleen@crossbreeze.com), other shepherds, the Yahoo ISBONA group, Pipestone Vets, or your own vet.   The Maryland Small Ruminant web site has a ton of information:  http://www.sheepandgoat.com/
Happy to announce all of my sheep for sale are SOLD! </p>
