					<h3> Information</h3>
          <p>  A prospective puppy buyer recently asked me some excellent questions.  I am going to re-post them here so you know more about our dogs: </p>
	<section class="question">
 <p><span class="Q"> Q1 </span> Hey we do have a few questions, how often do you have litters? </p>
	</section>
	<section class="answer">
  <p> Approximately one litter a year.</p>
</section>

<section class="question">
<p><span class="Q"> Q2 </span> Do you have any spaces left for puppies in this upcoming litter? </p>
</section>

<section class="answer">
  <p> No, I probably do not have spaces left for these litters. I like to see how many are born and make sure they are healthy before I make any promises to people.  Also, I want to do the best I can to find a good match of puppy to family. </p>
</section>

<section class="question">
  <p> <span class="Q"> Q3 </span> We were also wondering if you could give us a few details on how they are raised before leaving to live with their new family? </p>
</section>

<section class="answer">
  <p> They are born and raised in the house with my family. I usually am laying on the floor next to them as they are born and for the first couple of days I stay as close as possible. I do Early Neurological Stimulation which you can read about here: <a href="http://www.tehillahgermanshepherds.com/earlystimulation.html"> http://www.tehillahgermanshepherds.com/earlystimulation.html </a>
		 When they are older, I take them outside, weather permitting, for play times. Also, when they are older, I encourage friends with responsible children to come and meet the puppies as my kids are all young adults now. We have cats, horses, chickens, and sheep that they are allowed to see and interact with in a safe manner.  I have paper trained them to potty on newspapers in the past, but this time I will try to litter train them to a pan of pine shavings.  I have heard this is a good way to manage them when young.
		 I start crate training and leash training when they are getting closer to leaving for their new homes.  I try to think up new and interesting things for them to play on, in, and with such as wobble boards, small climbing toys, different chew toys, etc. Also, to meet new people and friendly dogs.  I think it is a plus that they interact with both their male and female dogs.  Laki is a great dog dad and very patient with puppies.</p>

<section class="question">
	<p><span class="Q"> Q4 </span>
   Also I would be new to owning an Icelandic Sheepdog, how busy do they need to be, currently planning on obediance and agility, in addition to daily walks and going to the park and things like that, is that enough or do they need more of a job? </p>
</section>

<section class="answer">
  <p> Your plans for agility and obedience sound wonderful.  They don't care that much what they do, as long as it is with you!  They do not like to be left alone too much.  If they are going to be alone all day, it helps to have another dog for company.  For agility, you would want a pretty high drive dog.  Fortunately (?), most of my puppies are pretty high energy.  The laid back ones are less common from my experience.  Be aware they can be noisy.  Again, this varies with the individual and how they are trained.  Nevertheless, they do LOVE to bark when they are working and playing. When they are in the house, they are pretty calm but are always up for a game! </p>
</section>

  <p>Thanks for the questions and let me know if you have more!
  We are members of the Icelandic Sheepdog Association of America (ISAA)- this is the only breed club for the Icelandic sheepdog that is recognized by the American Kennel Club. It is the only breed club that is sanctioned by Iceland and the ISIC </p>
